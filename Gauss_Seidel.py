    This is Gauss-Seidel iterative solution to a set of equations in an augmented matrix.
    Step 1:  Ensure the matrix is diagonal dominant (i.e., put the largest coefficient for a diagonal term on the diagonal
    by interchanging rows as necessary.  Note:  start at top and work your way to the bottom.
    Step 2:  Solve each row for corresponding x[row] in sequencence, using most recent values on rhs
    Solve first equation for x[0]=(A[0][n]-(A[0][1]*x[1]+A[0][2]*x[2]...A[0][n-1]*x[n-1]))/A[0][0]
    Updated value for x[0] is used in solution for x[1], etc.
    Once you've solved all the way to x[n-1], this is one iteration.
    Step 3:  Keep iterating for Niter or until the maximum change in a row of x is < epsilon

    :param Niter: number of iterations to get correct x
